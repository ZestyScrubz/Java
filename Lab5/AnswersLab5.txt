Answers for Lab 5
-----------------------------------------------



EXERCISE 1

1. Explain why there is a compiler error on each of the following lines.

a) Line 12
    There is an error because the code the code wont know if the if-statment will run.
    If it doesn't run, then the method wont return a boolean
b) Line 42
    Since the method m1 is not static, it cannot be called in the same class
c) Line 54
    k variable k is already defined earlier in the method, so the program wouldn't know
    which k to choose.



2. Why is there now a compiler error on Line 35?
    NUM_ITEMS is a FINAL variable and those variable are not allowed to change

3. Why is there a warning on Line 36?
    We are declaring the variable done but we never use it

4. Why is k incrementing in m1 but not updating in main?
    Because k in the m1 method is a local variable and does not share values with the variable in the main


EXERCISE 2

5. Why did testArray[0][0] not change?
    Because the variable j starts at 1 and not 0

6. What are the values of i and j? Is it correct that the program tries to store the value (i+1)*j in testArray[i][j]?
    The value of i is 0 and the value of j is 1. This is correct, but the arr[0][0] wont be filled


EXERCISE 3

7. What do you expect to be printed out from the 3 print statements?
    2 9 3

8. What values were actually printed out from the 3 print statements?
    2 9 3


EXERCISE 4

9. Write the type of exception (i.e. NullPointerException) that occurs from each of the 5 cases:

a) NullPointerException
b) ArrayIndexOutOfboudnsException
c) ArithmeticException
d) ClassCastException
e) NumberFormatException


10. How many exceptions occurred? What type(s) are they? Why aren't the other exceptions being thrown?
    1
    NullPointerException
    Because the first one crashes and the rest of the code doesn't run

11. What type of exception do you think was triggered in the m1(7) method call?
    ArrayIndexOutOfboudnsException
    m2 triggered ArrayIndexOutOfboudnsException
