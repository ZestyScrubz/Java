Answers for Lab 1
-----------------------------------------------


PRE-LAB

1. What javadoc tags will you use to document a method?
/* DOCUMMENTATION */ for multiline and // for single line


EXERCISE 1

2. What happens if in the constructor we do not use the keyword "this"? 
The code will break because the code won't know what variable is which if you are using the same variable.
We would be assigning the variable to itself which isn't very useful (name = name)


EXERCISE 2

3. What do you expect to be printed out in Step 11 ("Same player" or "Different player")?
I expect it to be different player because we are comparing if the object p1, with the default format and characters, 
is the same as p2, with the default format and character, which they are not 



EXERCISE 3

4. What do you expect to be printed out in Step 8 ("Same player" or "Different player")?
Now that we created a function .equals() that checks the name and the jersey number of each object, we are no longer comparing the default
format and the character, rather we are comparing the names and jersery number of each object. In this case they are the same,
so I expect it to print out Same player
